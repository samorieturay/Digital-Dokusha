During the past week, my primary focus was on ensuring the functionality of the Manga API. This involved fetching information related to specific manga series, including updating the current information and adding relevant images. I also worked on integrating this data into various HTML and JavaScript files.

I had to retrieve and display up-to-date information for manga series. This task required utilizing `api.js` to fetch data from the Manga API and testing API outputs using `apidemo.html` to understand how to handle and display the fetched data. I employed the basic `fetch` function to retrieve data and analyzed the outputs to ensure they could be correctly input into the HTML structure.

Next, I focused on developing the chapter page for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga series, working on `jjk-chapterpage-1.html` and `jjk-chapterpage-1.js`. I created basic HTML structures with placeholder elements to hold fetched chapter data and implemented JavaScript functions to fetch chapter details using the Manga API. By utilizing a for loop to iterate over the fetched chapter data, I was able to dynamically insert chapter names into the HTML placeholders.

Simultaneously, I developed the cover page for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga series, working on `jjk-manga-coverpage.html` and `jjk-manga-coverpage.js`. This involved setting up basic HTML structures with placeholder elements for cover page content and writing JavaScript functions to fetch cover page elements from the Manga API. I used a for loop to dynamically add images and other relevant data to the cover page placeholders.

Ensuring the correct mapping of manga data using unique Manga IDs was another crucial aspect of my work. I extracted Manga IDs from API outputs and constructed API URLs using these extracted IDs to fetch specific series data. Implementing logic to handle API responses ensured that data was correctly mapped and displayed in the HTML placeholders.

I checked the code to see but there was no issues there. I am going  to move on and continue to design the rest of the website and hopefully retry later on.

Last week, I made significant strides in addressing the website's scaling challenges by implementing the <meta name="viewport"> attribute, thereby ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I completed the development and design of key pages, including the creator.html upload page and the shop.html storefront. Furthermore, I refined the design and code for the popular.html page to optimize user engagement and navigation. These adjustments are aimed at improving functionality, aesthetics, and overall user experience on the website.

Last week, my focus was on refining the 'Pinterest' feature within the Gallery page. To kickstart this, I duplicated the existing gallery as 'art_page.html' and initiated a script aimed at fetching random images from 'dog.ceo/api' (currently a placeholder until the official API is integrated). The function 'fetchImageData()' was crafted for this purpose, tasked with retrieving images and arranging them atop one another for display. However, there are still some kinks to iron out; the formatting of images into boxes isn't functioning as intended. Additionally, the images are currently overlaying the website rather than being placed within it. These issues are noted and will be addressed promptly to ensure a seamless user experience. Additionally, I integrated an infinite scrolling mechanism akin to Pinterest's functionality within the "handleScroll" function. This enhancement allows users seamless and continuous scrolling through the gallery, ensuring a fluid browsing experience.

Last week, I concentrated on finalizing the design and functionality of our Forum and Shop pages. In the 'shop.html' file, I introduced visually appealing rounded rectangles to showcase products, incorporating key features like an "Add to Cart" button, a save option, and indicators for shipping type and product condition. Additionally, I implemented an extensive filters section on the right side of the page, enabling users to refine their product search based on Price, Condition, Reviews, and Popularity, with options ranging from price brackets to star ratings. On the Forum page, I revamped the layout by designing rounded rectangular boxes for each forum, displaying essential information such as titles, comment counts, likes, and the time since the last post. I also added rounded boxes as tabs to showcase recent posts and popular forums, enhancing user engagement. Moreover, I meticulously organized and split the previously HTML only files into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for all pages, streamlining the development process and improving collaboration among team members. These efforts represent significant strides towards creating a seamless and user-friendly browsing experience for our website visitors.

This week, my primary focus shifted towards research and debugging rather than active coding. The main objective was to address formatting issues with the images on the art page. This arose due to the decision by my teammates not to utilize the skeleton I had previously developed for other art pages during the sprint review. Consequently, my efforts were directed towards resolving the art page's formatting to ensure it was presentable for the review. I extensively worked with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the Gallery (Gallery.html, Gallery.css, Gallery.js) to diagnose the issue. After thorough examination, I identified that the root cause was not the script itself or the CSS styling, but rather the placement of the div id="container" class="cols" and div class="col" /div lines. Although the week was predominantly focused on troubleshooting, it provided valuable insights into code structure and layout. By delving deep into the codebase, I gained a better understanding of how various elements interact within the webpage layout, particularly in relation to image formatting. Moving forward, I aim to implement these insights to streamline the development process and ensure greater consistency across all pages, thereby enhancing the overall user experience of our website.

This week was predominantly dedicated to research and planning rather than hands-on coding. Recognizing the need for improved code readability, I invested time into exploring methods to streamline and organize the existing codebase. My code was too complicated to read with too many lines and not efficient, which stops my teammates from properly combining their code with mine. So Ive been finding a way to organize the code better and redesign the website as per request of my team members. Using resources such as the following YouTube tutorials, including  "60-30-10 Color Rule" by  Jesse Showalter, Hyperplexed's videos on  Js like "You Need This Hover Effect On Your Site ASAP (CSS / JS)", "How to Properly Layout A Website (For Beginners)" by The Website Architect, "HTML Tutorial - How to Make a Super Simple Website" by freeCodeCamp.org and among others. I gathered valuable insights to guide the redesign process. This period of research and learning has laid a strong foundation for optimizing our codebase and enhancing the user experience of our website.

Last week, I dedicated my efforts to redesigning the website, drawing inspiration from the provided videos. My focus was primarily focused on the home.html and home.css files, where I crafted elements such as the navigation bar, search bar, and manga previews, and the functionality for all of them. With these in place, I successfully established the foundational structure of the website. Additionally, I tackled the technical aspect by working on the api. In api.js, I configured the manga fetching API. I worked on aligning sections, resolving API integration issues, and getting the elements to align correctly. Looking ahead, I plan to refine the website design based on feedback, conduct thorough testing across different platforms, and collaborate with team members to further enhance the project. Overall, I am satisfied with the progress made and remain committed to continual learning and improvement in web development.
